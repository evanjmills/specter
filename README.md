### Original Project

This project is a rework of a hackathon project that I under took at HackKU2020 under the name [Now You See Me](https://github.com/Devin-Uner/Now_You_See_Me). 
The team consisted of Max Farver, Devin Uner, Will Smith, and myself. We set out to create an application that given a person's face would remove them from a live video stream. 

Given the time constraint of a hackathon (this one being 36 hours) I felt that we were very successful at implementing this. During the hackathon we were able to record the process of our development and a final demo video. If you are intrested checkout our [github repo](https://github.com/Devin-Uner/Now_You_See_Me) or the [project website](https://www.nowyouseeme.tech/).

### This Project

The purpose of this project is to revamp Now You See Me to be more efficent with the processing and add new fetures that we were unable to implement in the first run of the project.
